# Spark-Project
These projects consists of implementations of different algorithms as a prt of CSE587 Course.<br>
The code uses PySpark on CMU Movie CLassification Dataset <br>
The steps consisted of cleaning the text data of extraneous characters, performing feature engineering<br>
by using word2vec and then using Random Forest Classifier to classify the movies to their resepctive genres<br>
All the feature engineering algorithms and classifiers were used as a part of Spark MLLib API<br>
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle and the link is as follows: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dic487-587/data
